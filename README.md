# JID'S PASSWORD GENERATOR.

1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Using the same password across multiple accounts can lead to credential stuffing. Credential stuffing is when hackers use previously stolen login credentials from one website and then “stuff” these credentials into other websites until they find matches
ill save you the trouble of having to think about a strong password yourself.

2. SOLUTION STATEMENT

To avoid this as a software developer, I’ve decided to create a password generator website that can help society protect the security of their personal and professional email accounts, social network accounts, WiFi encryption, banking and financial and saving accounts. A passphrase generator will save you the trouble of having to think about a strong password yourself

*POINT OF NOTE* :  
The api I used has a specification of the length of the password were I selected 10 that is why my password generator doesn't have an option to change length of the password (It's constant to 10 characters).
